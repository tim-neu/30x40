# 30x40
Change the Conversation

For too long now the conversation and debate about climate change has focused on one thing: limits. We’ve been told that our only options are to stop, reduce, and limit: reduce greenhouse gas emissions, limit our energy use, slow our economy, and even limit our freedom.

But today the conversation has changed. We can solve the problems of global warming and climate change not by limiting but by growing; not by scaling back or slowing down but by speeding up and building out. Rather than argue over what we can’t do, we understand now what we can do. We can produce new energy. We can make our economy bigger, stronger, and more durable. We can create new jobs: skilled, high-paying jobs. We can create almost unlimited opportunities for new investment.

We can solve global warming and have the energy we need, the jobs we want, and the economy that all of us deserve. We can simultaneously provide energy to billions while preventing the build-up of pollution in our atmosphere. We don’t need to cut, reduce, limit, or scale back. Instead, we build, develop, create, and grow. And we are doing it now.

What is 30x40 (30 by 40)?

“30x40” means 30 terawatts (TW) of solar and wind energy around the world by the year 2040 in orderto avoid the most harmful and dangerous effects of global warming and climate change.

Carbon Dioxide and Global Warming

Because of human activity, levels of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere have been rising year after year – increasing 15% in just the past 30 years. Every day, humans pump 100 million tons of carbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere from fossil fuel burning.

We are the first humans in history to ever live on the Earth when so much carbon dioxide is in our atmosphere. The last time the Earth had so much carbon dioxide in the air – over 400 parts per million (ppm) – the oceans were 80 feet higher than today, the Earth’s average temperature was 10 degrees warmer, and humans didn’t exist.
